# Contributing to iyanls

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for wanting to contribute - you're awesome!

## Getting Started

First things first, let's get you set up:

1. **Fork this repo** - Hit that fork button up top
2. **Clone your fork** - `git clone https://github.com/lordpaijo/iyanls.git`
3. **Install dependencies** - Follow the setup instructions in the README
4. **Create a branch** - `git checkout -b your-cool-feature`

## How to Contribute

### Found a Bug? 🐛
- Check if someone already reported it in [Issues](../../issues)
- If not, create a new issue with:
  - What did you expect to happen
  - What actually happened
  - Steps to reproduce (the more detailed, the better!)
  - Your OS, browser, or environment info

### Want to Add Something Cool? ✨
- Open an issue first to discuss your idea (saves everyone time!)
- We love new features, but let's make sure they fit the project's direction
- Once we give it a thumbs up, go ahead and code it up

### Code Style & Standards
We're pretty chill about code style, but here are the basics:
- Keep it readable (your future self will thank you)
- Add comments for the tricky bits
- If there's a linter (say, Clippy), make it happy
- Write tests if you can (we won't cry if you don't, but we might smile if you do)

## Making a Pull Request

Ready to submit your changes? Sweet!

1. **Push your branch** - `git push origin your-cool-feature`
2. **Open a PR** - Use our template (it's pretty painless)
3. **Wait for review** - We'll try to get back to you quickly
4. **Make changes if needed** - No worries, happens to the best of us
5. **Celebrate** 🎉 - You just made the project better!

## PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on one thing (easier to review)
- Write a decent description of what you changed
- Link any related issues
- Be patient with reviews - we're probably just as excited as you are!

## Questions?

Stuck on something? Don't be shy!
- Open an issue with the `question` label
- Tag a maintainer if it's urgent
- Check existing issues - someone might've asked the same thing

## Code of Conduct
